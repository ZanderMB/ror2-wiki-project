1,,Acrid,160 (+48),15 (+3),2.5,Melee / Ranged,20,7,300,"An imposingly large, poison-spewing ex-prisoner, Acrid fights with a potent array of damage-over-time effects and a self-sustaining melee ability. In addition to sporting the highest base damage stat of any Survivor barring the  Heretic, Acrid’s mix of long-range and crowd control allow for excellent damage potential."
2,,Artificer,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"Wielding a diverse armament of destructive skills, Artificer's strength lies in her devastating offense that can break through even the bulkiest of enemies, aided by the versatile Snapfreeze. However, her power comes at the cost of survivability, as she has no defensive or movement skills aside from her high-flying Ion Surge, so the player must be adept at dodging and be especially aware of their surroundings."
3,,Bandit,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"A swift and sneaky fighter, the Bandit focuses on keeping on the move to catch enemies off guard and deal ruinous damage, before finishing the job with  Lights Out. Between his daggers, smoke bombs, and gun attacks, the Bandit emphasizes mobility and versatility but also requires some skill to bring out his true potential."
4,,CHEF,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"A survivor of high class, CHEF specializes in only the most exquisite meals and combos. As a culinary master, CHEF uses a variety of practiced skills in tandem for additional benefits."
5,,Captain,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"Commander of the UES Safe Travels, the Captain's strength is his ability to call down a variety of tactical drops from orbit, from a humble healing beacon to the spectacularly cataclysmic OGM-72 'DIABLO' Strike."
6,,Commando,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"Unlocked by default, he is intended as a well-rounded and easily-understood character with no particular weaknesses or strengths, combining mobility and offense in his tactics. Despite his ostensibly simple skills, Commando benefits greatly from the effects of item stacking given his high attack speed and equally high proc coefficient."
7,,Engineer,130 (+39),14 (+2.8),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"With an assortment of deployable gadgets, the Engineer's strength comes not from him alone, but rather his ability to set up a variety of defensive measures. The Engineer's signature ability is his deployable turrets, which gain the same items that Engineer himself has. This makes him unique, as item selection doesn't necessarily come down to what benefits himself, but also what can benefit his turrets."
8,,False Son,180 (+54),13 (+2),1,Melee,20,7,100,"He is a slow, close-range warrior with high HP and bonuses for items that boost HP. His Club of the Forsaken and Step of the Brothers can deal large close-range damage, while Lunar Spike and Laser of the Father can pick off enemies at a distance. The trade-off with Lunar Spikes incentivizes reserving spikes for the two slow-charged attacks to increase attack speed and armor for heavy damage, and using the spikes when escaping or recovering health."
9,,Heretic,440 (+132),18 (+3.6),-6,Ranged,0,8,100,"The Heretic cannot be selected from the character selection screen at the start of a run. Instead, she must be transformed into by holding all 4 Heresy items at once. The items in the set, and their respective skills, are: Visions of Heresy, Hooks of Heresy, Strides of Heresy, Essence of Heresy. Along with her skills, the Heretic has extremely high base health, can triple jump, moves slightly faster than any other Survivor, and has a considerably higher base damage stat. However, she has negative health regeneration, causing her to lose health over time instead of recovering it, which scales positively with higher difficulties."
10,,Huntress,90 (+27),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"With homing attacks, great mobility, and low health, the Huntress is a fragile but mobile character focused on evasion, which is especially important considering her low damage output. She is unlocked by default as an alternative to Commando."
11,,Loader,160 (+48),12 (+2.4),2.5,Melee,20,7,150,"An incredibly mobile and heavy cargo loader, the Loader is capable of delivering some of the hardest-hitting attacks in the game. When utilizing velocity to her advantage, she is able to topple many powerful monsters in just a single punch."
12,,MUL-T,200 (+60),11 (+2.2),1,Melee / Ranged,12,7,200,"A modified multi-purpose robot, MUL-T lives up to its designation through its sheer versatility. Highly durable in terms of both high health and armor, it possesses the unique ability to select two of four primary weapons and utilize them in two different configurations: either swapping between two weapons and equipment via Retool, or utilizing two primary weapons at once in the armored Power Mode."
13,,Mercenary,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Melee,20,7,150,"A highly mobile and maneuverable fighter, the Mercenary strikes swiftly and rapidly to devastate enemies, gaining both invincibility and mobility with his various attacks. Due to his skills' low cooldowns (which are further reduced by his signature. Expose debuff), his playstyle focuses on repeatedly chaining together attacks to stay on the offensive in any situation."
14,,REX,130 (+39),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,20,7,150,"REX’s attacks are powerful and strike from a great distance, but in exchange, some require REX's health as a resource. Proper skill timing and health management are required to keep REX in the fight. In addition to health stealing and powerful group management, REX can put weakening on opponents to help REX deal more damage and take less."
15,,Railgunner,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"A lethal and skillful markswoman, the Railgunner fights with her eponymous railgun. In combination with powerful piercing shots and smart homing rounds, Railgunner has incredible long-range damage output and decent crowd control options. Her signature ability is the incredibly powerful, all-or-nothing Supercharge that can devastate even the strongest of enemies in a single shot."
16,,Seeker,115 (+34),12 (+2.4),0.75,Melee / Ranged,20,7,100,"Utilizing spiritual forces and tranquility, The Seeker's strength is her ability to heal - or sometimes revive - her allies, providing powerful support while also able to stand her ground against powerful enemies."
17,,Void Fiend,110 (+33),12 (+2.4),1,Ranged,0,7,100,"It is an eldritch, void-mutated monstrosity capable of harnessing the Void as a lethal weapon. In battle, its corrupted energy builds up until it reaches a critical point, unleashing its full power and transforming it and its abilities into more aggressive versions."
